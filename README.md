## Product Market Fit

Even though we launch the project under MiCA regulation within EU boundaries, the holders of gold token may be any algorand user worldwide.

Target audience of the gold token are:

- Small investors who want to invest into gold on periodic basis
- Large investors who want to hedge their portfolios
- Projects which wants to have their token to be backed by real gold, for example https://stabilitas.finance
- Eshop owners who want to utilize algorand's efficient blockchain, but do not want to use volatile asset
- Restaurants who want to allow their customers to pay with gold
- Undeveloped countries with high inflation

Our revenue stream is from the Onramp solution which combines bank world with crypto world, and real gold coins eshop sale to public, and market inetrventions.

We have launched a DAO governance token with stable price peg to USD, which may allow further financing.
