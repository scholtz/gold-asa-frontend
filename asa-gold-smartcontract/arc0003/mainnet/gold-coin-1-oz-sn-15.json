Since 1989 it has been struck in the Vienna Mint in four sizes and weights (1 ounce, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/10 of an ounce). And the motif of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra which is considered to be one of the best music ensembles worldwide, was not chosen by coincidence. The coin is minted of the purest 24 carat gold. In 2002, the original 2000, 1000, 500 and 250 shilling coins were replaced with 100, 50, 25 and 10 euro coins. The obverse of the coins features the organ in the Golden Hall of the Musikverein in Vienna, the renowned seat of  the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The reverse is decorated with various musical instruments. Gold coin with serial number XIV is special as it was minted one day before the Algorand meetup in Prague and one month before the #Decipher2024.","pictures":[{"url":"ipfs://QmYeCHutVRnBmPeFTMEJkAKDzq9kwmQ9HeHKNX9NJtScSA","integrity":"sha256-0hGBhhA2nyMw5HVtW3mU2nlB7VPEjUA9LRRdjRj3p/o=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmQy8Komdta2qReTBEywDiUuSCeCTqLYWnp9bVJLRxntTs","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-3HSA6+aHaOXmO5xtewTxzYwmQfjPdZ//YKdsPPzmiPY=","mimetype":"image/png"},{"url":"ipfs://QmZhdz6kGPskHp9eNE2i91si2BWmGeP3JfJfrqDursNvgN","integrity":"sha256-EbTHYWJcUlQqkqPN+KkxxYFwFO55FyitGLCErq24fe8=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmcNGodrDqrpSjWFBvwS5aZC6eVvWrbmFJvFqdXJbMWCvb","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-KW1DLPE2hRI0ZJk4kdVBf8O0aUAnTQ2SI8gKvUDe/cw=","mimetype":"image/png"}]}}
