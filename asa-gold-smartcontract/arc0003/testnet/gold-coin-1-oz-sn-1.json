Martin Dašek","quality":"proof","story":"The Slovaks have waited patiently for the opportunity for self-determination - like a bird of prey circling in the sky above the majestic Tatra Mountains, looking for its prey. It is no wonder that Slovak poets and revivalists of the 19th century regarded the eagle as a soulmate and that Ľudovít Štúr himself named the cultural supplement of the Slovak National Newspaper 'Orol tatránski'. Despite the unwilling attempts of the sovereign rulers, the Slovaks preserved their culture, language and character until they finally succeeded in winning their independence. The symbol of all they achieved was once again the eagle, which has always represented strength, victory, freedom and nobility, but also resurrection and new life. The bird of prey, which represents the Christian kingdom of heaven, also refers to Slovak religious tradition.","pictures":[{"url":"ipfs://QmVzPGqxvFxg3SX6G2LPQG8svbc79RyvBLFq8frVsyQ7z8","integrity":"sha256-35zqmFYF7O7YjOYLPDtKDrFS096QAq5IUs1Z1igBWjo=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmQnfCcdhGwGMQjNrW1p3p9jVetUt26DskJvfwVhdg3Gp3","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-6NtOHhhrnmj6Z6zkmFx2q5WzA2R3jGvD5oMFwIx7w+I=","mimetype":"image/png"},{"url":"ipfs://QmPgxiGsKYuBfDpgMgmJTKi4nou2qgC6hENCJe42C1KXDa","integrity":"sha256-ciSK/mqE0/SgsVjHME5vVehuyVArziJwVxy3p06cs2o=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmSHkUmWy6QjePs28UPz12RSLcXAwuZuL86DrfGbRkEqTa","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-uCp5rFFvz689maTSk5kdeXlfKRmRItmffV5MImNV3ng=","mimetype":"image/png"},{"url":"ipfs://Qmf8yis5ER6prXdTnkAvt1jNRG7uAB67Vx2BuR8DGp7x8s","integrity":"sha256-m67T8TaPQxGh2ggpsfeUqfNECdUTl7FO9kF9qcKvW5w=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmcXbVpixSDamLXsBTWPUigeEctqWU3JhnKdbDrMt2SuAb","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-FPVjcFxIZpf6DV/h8tdZ/lNER7HcLbEhluwICNOCtvc=","mimetype":"image/png"},{"url":"ipfs://QmX5pRKvAfyzd8xR3XBnn2eRNKwe8EETwzRAGC4JFBqhoL","integrity":"sha256-dkSUaCNzNblJKBEyNycZCvHgti6vgrwVufPkbuHErcY=","thumbnail":"ipfs://QmekXfDzpuwG1uDCHW1jjLrtqMVv2udySzufAmHBTiVibF","thumbnailIntegrity":"sha256-x3UAC/+JuPo9uzSsEUs0nEUDNxc6RiHEut7e1PLRFGM=","mimetype":"image/png"}]}}
